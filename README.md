_This is not an official Travis County application._

This interactive command-line utility creates selective lists of registered voters from the voter files of Travis County, TX, as distributed by the Travis County Tax Office.

Users first select a precinct to work in. They may then select one or more streets to include in their list. If one street is selected, users may input a set of specific houses to work inâ€”and if one primary address is selected, users may similarly limit their list to a specific set of units.

Note that Texas voter data, such as the data processed by this program is protected from commercial use by state law, per Section 18.009 of the Texas Election Code (included below as it was after the 85th Texas Legislature):

> Sec. 18.009.  UNLAWFUL USE OF INFORMATION ON REGISTRATION LIST.  (a)  A person commits an offense if the person uses information in connection with advertising or promoting commercial products or services that the person knows was obtained under Section 18.008.
> (b)  An offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor.

Voter files distributed on the Tax Office website currently carry a notice to this effect; this program prints that notice.
